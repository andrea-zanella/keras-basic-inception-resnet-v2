# keras-basic-inception-resnet-v2
This is a very simple implementation of the inception resnet v2 model on keras.

## Requirements
You will need 2 files from the official keras repo: https://github.com/fchollet/keras :
- keras/applications/inception_resnet_v2.py
- keras/applications/imagenet_utils.py

Place(replace) them in your keras/applications folder (usually at "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/keras" but it could be different.

You have to replace these two files so you can easy use the inception resnet v2 model.
